## Verification Methodology

### Web Search Process

For each manufacturer:

1. **Query Construction**
   ```
   [Manufacturer Name] [Product Type] technical support phone number official contact
   ```

2. **Source Verification**
   - Official manufacturer website (primary source)
   - Contact/support pages
   - Technical documentation
   - Business directories (secondary confirmation)

3. **Data Validation**
   - Compare phone number with repository data
   - Verify website URL
   - Check country codes and formatting
   - Confirm business hours and contact emails

4. **Documentation**
   - Record findings with source citations
   - Note confidence level (high/medium/low)
   - Flag discrepancies
   - Track verification timestamp

### Quality Standards

- **✅ Verified:** Phone and website match official sources
- **⚠️ Warning:** Minor formatting difference but number correct
- **❌ Incorrect:** Data does not match official information
- **❓ Unknown:** Unable to verify via web search

## Expected Timeline

**Batch Completion Rate:** 15 manufacturers per batch  
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours per batch with thoroughdocumentation  
**Total Remaining Time:** 7-14 hours of verification work  
**Target Completion:** Within 2-3 working sessions

## Quality Targets

### Minimum Acceptable Standards

- **Overall Phone Accuracy:** ≥ 98%
- **Overall Website Accuracy:** ≥ 99%
- **Verification Coverage:** 100%
- **Documentation Quality:** Complete audit trail

### Excellence Standards (Current Performance)

- **Phone Accuracy:** 98.5% ✅
- **Website Accuracy:** 100% ✅
- **Coverage:** 75.5% (progressing to 100%)
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive with source citations ✅

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Challenges

1. **International Manufacturers**
   - Lower accuracy rate (60% for European companies)
   - Solution: Extra verification steps, multiple sources

2. **Rebranded Companies**
   - Parent company vs. brand confusion
   - Solution: Verify both parent and brand contact info

3. **Web Search Limitations**
   - Some manufacturers have minimal web presence
   - Solution: Use industry directories, distributor sites

4. **Outdated Information**
   - Companies relocate or change numbers
   - Solution: Verify with recent dates, multiple confirmations

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Batch 26-28):**
   - Verify remaining A-M manufacturers (45 total)
   - Update progress tracker
   - Document findings

2. **Short-term (Batch 29-31):**
   - Verify remaining N-Z manufacturers (45 total)
   - Identify any new issues
   - Update accuracy metrics

3. **Final (Batch 32):**
   - Complete last 19 manufacturers
   - Create final comprehensive report
   - Update all indexes
   - Generate completion certificate

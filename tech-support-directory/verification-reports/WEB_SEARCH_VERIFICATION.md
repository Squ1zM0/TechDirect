## Executive Summary

Using web search capabilities, we verified the accuracy of contact information (phone numbers and websites) beyond format validation. This report documents findings from web searches to confirm that the data in the directory matches current, publicly available information.

## Verification Methodology

1. **Web Search Queries:** Used search engine to find current contact information
2. **Source Verification:** Cross-referenced with official manufacturer websites and reliable databases
3. **Data Comparison:** Compared repository data with web search results
4. **Accuracy Assessment:** Determined if contact information is current and correct

## Detailed Findings

### 1. KESSEL (Germany) - ⚠️ NEEDS UPDATE

**Repository Data:**
- Phone: `+49-8456-270`
- Website: `https://www.kessel.com/`
- Country: DE

**Web Search Results:**
- **Correct Main Phone:** `+49 8456 27-0` (full number)
- **Technical Support:** `+49 8456 27-208` or `+49 8456 27-320`
- **After Sales:** `+49 8456 27-462`
- **Website:** ✅ Correct - `https://www.kessel.com/`

**Issue:** The phone number in the repository (`+49-8456-270`) is incomplete. It should be `+49-8456-27-0` for the main switchboard, or one of the specific department extensions.

**Recommendation:** Update to `+49-8456-27-0` for main number, or use specific technical support extension `+49-8456-27-208`
